        For now, a student pursuing an undergraduate degree at a university. My main goal, for now, is to become a full-stack web developer to work on exciting and perspective projects and also to implement my ideas into reality. I am currently attending several self-paced courses about web development. 
        Very motivated to learn new things about web development and meet new people in the IT industry, and I am a good team player. I love challenges and the process of overcoming them.
